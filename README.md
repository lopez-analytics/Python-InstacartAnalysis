# Python-InstacartAnalysis
Instacart Analysis Using Python

Project Overview
In this project, a population flow diagram was created, and Python was utilized for data
consistency checks and wrangling. Columns were derived, analysis was conducted,
visualizations were generated, and recommendations were provided to the client.

Objective
Instacart, an online grocery store with strong sales, seeks deeper insights into their sales
patterns. As an analyst, my task was to perform an initial exploratory data analysis to derive
insights and suggest strategies for better customer segmentation based on specific criteria.

Key Questions
1. What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day for orders, to help schedule
ads during less busy times?
2. Are there specific times when people spend the most money, informing the type of
products to advertise?
3. How can products be grouped into simpler price ranges for marketing and sales efforts?
4. Which product categories are most popular?
5. How do different customer types and their ordering behaviors vary? Consider:
- Brand loyalty distribution and its impact on ordering habits.
- Differences in ordering habits by customer loyalty status.
- Regional differences in ordering habits.
- The relationship between age, family status, and ordering habits.
- Demographic classifications such as age, income, goods type, and family status.
- Differences in ordering habits across customer profiles, including order price,
frequency, and product types.

Data
The analysis utilized the following datasets:
- Customers
- Orders
- Orders_products_prior
- Products
- Departments

Tools
Python and the following libraries were used for the analysis:
- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical computations
- Seaborn: for data visualizations
- Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical computations

Folder Structure
The project files are organized as follows:
1. 01 Project Management: Contains the project brief.
2. 02 Data: Contains two subfolders - Original Data (original data frames) and Prepared
Data (cleaned and prepared data frames). (Data files are not uploaded to GitHub due to size
limitations.)
3. 03 Scripts: Contains Jupyter notebooks with the analysis code.
4. 04 Analysis: Contains visualizations used to develop and explain insights.
5. 05 Sent to Client: Contains the final report in Excel format.

Resources
Note: Instacart is a real company that has made their data available online. The project brief
contents are fabricated by CareerFoundry for the purpose of this analysis.
